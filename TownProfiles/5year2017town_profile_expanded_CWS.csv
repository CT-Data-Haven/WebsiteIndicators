See http://ctdatahaven.org/reports/datahaven-community-wellbeing-survey for more information on the survey methodology. For all other data, margins of error represent the 90% confidence interval for estimates. With 90% confidence, each estimate falls between a lower limit (subtracting margin of error from estimate) and an upper limit (adding margin of error to estimate).
